#' Weger et al. 2018 RNA-seq of Male Mouse Liver
#'
#' Quantifications of bulk RNA-seq data of liver samples from 12 male mice.
#' This includes only the conventionally raised mice from the experiment.
#' Mice were collected around the clock at four hour intervals.
#' See PMID: 30344015 for description of experimental and sequencing setup.
